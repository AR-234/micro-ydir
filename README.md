- Copy/Cut/Paste of files within ydir

## Usage
copy plugin into `.config/micro/plug/ydir/`

ctrl+e `ydir tab` to open ydir in a new tab

all possible options:
 - `ydir current` save current buffer and open ydir in it (saving can be disabled)
 - `ydir hsplit` 
 - `ydir vsplit`
 - `ydir tab`

See configure to know how to bind this

## Movement
Cursor movement will traverse in the filesystem
Up/down to scroll through the files
Left/Backspace go to parent directory
Right/Enter open file/directory

Mark and unmark files by indentation (tab-default)

Insert will prompt for file creation
Delete for deletion, needs to be accepted with y for files and yes to recursivly delete directories
for smaller keyboard layouts other keys for these actions need to be binded, see below
